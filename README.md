# CrowdSafe - Real-Time Crowd Detection using YOLOv8

A project built for the **Smart India Hackathon 2025**, CrowdSafe leverages advanced computer vision algorithms to detect and monitor crowd density in videos. The system focuses on real-time detection and analysis, ensuring public safety by classifying crowd levels as **Low**, **Moderate**, or **High** based on the number of people detected in each frame.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ” Detects and counts humans in pre-recorded videos using **YOLOv8**.  
âœ” Filters out irrelevant objects like bottles, cars, etc., focusing only on people.  
âœ” Displays bounding boxes around detected persons in each frame.  
âœ” Adds a dynamic crowd density bar at the bottom of the video.  
âœ” Classifies the crowd into three levels:  
   - **Low** (green),  
   - **Moderate** (yellow),  
   - **High** (red).  
âœ” Outputs the processed video with overlays and analytics.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy

## YOLOv8 Weights

This project uses the **YOLOv8 Large** model (`yolovl.pt`) for object detection.
